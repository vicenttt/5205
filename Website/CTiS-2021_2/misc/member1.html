<h2> Ethical Reflections </h2>
<p>Our group topic is investigate how can big data technology real impact in digital advertising, big data three characteristics has been identified as volume,velocity and variety,     just recently there was added to the big data technology including veracity, value and variability. Every day in the world there will be a large amount of data created. More surprising is the fact that almost accounted for ninety percent of them are unstructured or big data. In my opinion, if digital advertisers make good use of them. Then, that is real good way to improved the performance of them service significantly, Opportunities provided by big data to the advertisers will extract the apporpriate information like marketing message and users consumptive habit used to make the future decison. Besides, for the users can give them a good user experience.But also every advantage has its disadvantage,some users might get dissatisfied, they might feeling been watched, because advertisers collecting data everywhere like form every social media they registered, So when advertisers serve ads to users they should be conscious of users' privacy not steps over the line.
