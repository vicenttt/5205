<h1>Project Portfolio</h1><br>

<p>Our team divides project work into four phases including: Analysis(planning stage, choose topic, divide up the work), Design (early prototypes, summarising the proposal, start creating slides for the Project Proposal Presentation), Development (look at our topic in more depth,exploring the opportunities, risks, choices for the topic we investigate,making Project Presentation slides), and Implementation( designing the team pages,making team website more complete, final check for all workings).<br>
<h4><p>Team members roles and responsibilities:</p></h4><br>
<p>At the planning stage we assign our team roles,recorder duties include accurate indicating each meeting time date, member attendance.And focus on the record for later view, write down any details or ideas during meeting for further viewing, researcher duties include find relevant materials for the topic, select useful information from the materials supporting arguments.Add the information to presentation slides and website.Web developer responsible for making the web page, manage files on github and integrated landscaping pages.During the task while we focus on our assigned roles we might not only carried out our own responsibilities but also cooperated with the rest part.For example recorder and researcher can also do some web design work,web designer can do some of the research. Team members roles is the way by each team members will work towards the success of this assignment on each role varies to some extent as well.<br>
