<p>Overview :<br>
  With the advent of the information age and the continuous  progress of computer science, big data has gradually become an indispensable  tool in modern life.  The emergence of  big data as a new model provides unparalleled composition and value for  enterprises.  The growth of big data has  brought challenges to the fields of processing, analysis, sharing and  visualization.  This brings us new  choices, opportunities and challenges.    The strong point of big data computing is that it can use computers to  analyze massive data, and then get more valuable information, and this  information obtained through a large number of calculations is the real value  of big data. On top of pure profit-making, big data has a more comprehensive  use, not to increase income as the main function.  Big data is helpful for understanding the  spread of diseases, planning disaster relief measures after natural disasters,  and formulating detailed policy plans.   Big data can also unlock the secrets of our current world and help us  plan the future path.<br>
  Big data technology can bring many new possibilities to  people ' s lives because of its advanced and scientific characteristics. How to  use this technology is an urgent need for us to discuss.  Big data technology can efficiently process  fuzzy information, intelligently process network information data, and greatly  reduce the cost of data processing.  With  reasonable utilization, it well serves many fields in our modern life.  However, big data itself is also a  double-edged sword.  It will bring us  potential risks while providing us with convenience, which requires us or  enterprises to weigh and choose between the two.<br>
  For example, ecommerce companies such as Alibaba and Amazon  can judge a user 's preferences, personality and value orientation by analyzing  big data, and draw a user 's ' user portrait ', which helps organizations  identify the target group they should target, and then accurately deliver  advertising goods to target users to enhance the success rate of commodity  sales.  At the same time, these  enterprises can also choose to sell this precise user portrait as a specific  product or service to other enterprises or departments to obtain more  benefits.  However, it is undeniable that  the user ' s personal information as a commodity sales of this commercial  behavior is very high risk and unreasonable, which will lead to the leakage of  personal privacy of users and the deterioration of the Internet ecological  environment, and ultimately will cause adverse effects on the production and  operation of the enterprise itself.   Therefore, how to use big data this tool is very important, enterprises  and individuals need to make a good choice, reasonable and safe use of big data  this tool, Big data has the ability to fundamentally change the business model.  Whether through drastic changes or smooth transition, how to use this tool  properly and effectively is particularly important.<br>
  In addition to enterprises, big data computing can also play  a greater role in government departments.   In terms of political decision-making, the government can understand  people &rsquo; s opinions on a certain policy by collecting poll information in  various regions, which helps the government to modify or formulate more  effective policies that are in line with people &rsquo; s expectations.  In addition, the government can also collect  the opinions and suggestions of people who belong to different groups in  different occupations in various regions, so as to judge the support rate of  their own political parties in a certain type of population, which helps the  political parties to understand their competitive advantages, and then develop  a system with more distinctive characteristics of the party itself to attract  voters.  However, as the previous example  of e-commerce enterprises, big data calculation may also have a negative effect  in government departments.  For example,  political parties may use voter information from big data analysis to make  targeted policies to attack hostile parties, which may lead to endless  political struggles within the top government.   Therefore, how to use the tool of big data calculation well has become a  crucial issue.<br>
  The era of big data needs the help of artificial  intelligence to create more benefits for society.  The application of computer network  technology can greatly improve the security and convenience of the network,  have more efficient and accurate data processing, optimize computer technology,  and have a great impact on people 's lives and work.<br>
  In summary, Big data because of its unique nature and powerful  practical role, he needs users to make full preparations to seriously consider  whether their choice can play its practical role well.  To avoid unnecessary trouble while profiting  from its advantages. </p>
