<h2>Ethical Issues and Reflections</h2>
<p><h3>The ethical problems of the big data technology
The ethical problems of the big DT (data technology)：One of the issues is the leakage of personalized privacy. Personal information that includes identity, behavior, property, and even religion, emotion, social relation can be recorded, held, and exposed, which leads to the impossible of protecting privacy. Secondly, the security of the information is a big issue. In many cases, it is difficult to protect the data information that produced by individual. Thirdly, nowadays the information technology is imperfect that still exits many security flaws, which can result in data breaches and lower information security. 
There are three basic principles: firstly, we believe that the purpose of the development of the big DT is to improve the life quality. Secondly, people that who search and use the data information should be responsibility for the security. Thirdly, users of the data information should inform the producers, which is the producers of the data information should be fully endowed with the right to know and the right of the data storage, deletion, and use.  
The most effective solution is to promote the technological progress. With entering the era of DT, under the consensus of the open exchange and sharing of data, people’s perception of the privacy is changing that the awareness of privacy is reducing gradually. For the protection of personal information security, the ideology of the public should be fit with the big data environment.
