<h1>Technology Risks</h1>
<h4><p>Big data era Internet platform advertising although compared to traditional advertising has inherent advantages, Internet precision advertising has been the future development trend. Precise advertising can be placed according to the advertising content, choose to put in the client intelligent recommended channel, choose specific target users and regions, using text, pictures or video three forms, precise advertising to users, can try the region, industry direction and so on. However, due to the immaturity of the technology and the lack of management, Internet precision advertising still faces many difficulties and shortcomings. For example, there are problems such as false propaganda and single advertising content, as well as poor user experience due to deviations in advertising positioning and user resistance due to intensive placement. Finally, there are risks such as data forgery and data leakage.
  <p></h4>

    <h2><p>Advertising content level</p></h2>
    <ol>
    <h3><li><p> Misrepresentation and misrepresentation of advertising content</p></li></h3>
    <h4><p>With the rise of internet advertising, more and more advertisers are choosing new media platforms to promote their products. As a result, many of these platforms have become "flawed" and there are many false and even illegal advertisements.</p></h4>
    <h4><p> Many of the pictures or videos that consumers see of products are carefully typeset and post-processed, and the products are placed in the most suitable scenarios, with the most suitable people showing the advantages of the products. Big Data's strategy of accurately targeting ads will lose its effectiveness.
    </p></h4>
    <h3><li><p> Single advertising content</p></li></h2>
      <h4><p>The huge commercial value of the Internet advertising industry attracts a large number of sellers and advertisers, but as more and more businesses are stationed on Internet advertising platforms, the content of the advertisements is single. The same template with a new product is a new advertisement, and the increasing number of imitators makes the problem of homogenisation of internet advertising more and more serious.
      </p></h4>
      <h4><p>The problem of homogeneity in internet advertising is becoming more and more serious. Unless the consumer is already interested in the product and wants to learn about its efficacy or promotional activities, this is already a case of the consumer learning about the advertisement rather than the advertisement attracting the consumer, which greatly defeats the original purpose of the advertisement, not to mention the effectiveness of the advertisement.
      </p></h4>
    
    </ol>

    <h2><p>Advertising Platform Placement</p></h2>
    <ol>
      <h3><li> Poor positioning leads to poor user experience</li></h3>
      <h4><p>The use behaviour of a large number of Internet users has generated a large amount of data, but the value of big data does not lie in the data itself, but in the corresponding audience based on user usage data mining, which is also the key to accurate placement of big data advertising.
      </p></h4>
      <h4><p>Big data application technology is not yet mature, and there are still many problems that have not been solved, resulting in a certain gap between the specific ideal "precision" of accurate placement, poor user experience, and sometimes even resistance to the psychology
      </p></h4>
      <h4><p>People have complex psychological activities, and immature big data algorithms are still at the stage of combining mass marketing and precision placement, and can only paint a vague picture of user characteristics based on their preferences, browsing time and number of clicks.
      </p></h4>
      <h4><p>The combination of in-platform and even out-of-platform user behaviour to push relevant, but not fully relevant, content to the audience can lead to a feeling of being watched rather than truly understood, which can lead to a sense of resistance.
      </p></h4>
      <h4><p>Finally, due to immature technology, there is sometimes a lag in the speed of database updates. People's preferences change all the time, depending on mood, environment, opportunity and other changing factors, so if ads keep chasing rather than guiding users' preferences and repeatedly pushing 'out-of-date content', the ads will not be as effective as they could be. Or when consumers have already completed their consumption behaviour and the database is still pushing ads for the same products afterwards, this is clearly pointless.
      </p></h4>
      <h3><li> Intensive placement leads to user resistance</li></h3>
      <h4><p>The advent of the Internet era has changed people's way of life, and the increasingly fast pace of life has led to a gradual fragmentation of the way people obtain information, with audiences becoming more inclined to "short information" rather than "long information" and "dynamic information" rather than "static information". dynamic information" rather than "static information".
      </p></h4>
      <h4><p>The increasing number of internet advertisements has brought revenue to the platforms and also put pressure on them to increase the intensity and frequency of pushing advertisements to users in order to accommodate all the advertisers. The over-intensive pushing of single-content advertisements can have a negative impact on the audience's reading, creating resistance and even reducing trust in the platform and user stickiness. 
      </p></h4>
    </ol>

    <h2><p>Advertising platforms</p></h2>
    <ol>
      <h3><li> Data falsification and data leakage</li></h3>
      <h4><p> In the era of big data, data means traffic, and traffic means profit. The risk of data falsification will be brought about by profit-driven situation. Many new media APPs will inflate their value by misrepresenting the click-through rate. This also creates the problem of unfair competition through data monopoly and data falsification.
      </p></h4>
      <h4><p>Big data technology can be used to infer users' preferences and habits by capturing their browsing history. Sometimes, when we search for a certain product in a browser, a particular webpage or software will push the product for you, making the audience feel like they are a "transparent person" in front of the Internet and under some kind of surveillance, which raises concerns about the leakage of their privacy.
      </p></h4>
      <h4><p>In the internet age, people are often unintentionally or even forced to leave information about their true identity when they go online. Based on the various browsing information left behind, back-end data can generate information about the user's true age, education, job, etc.
      </p></h4>
      <h4><p>This information is also the core strength of major industries that want to promote their products, but once this information is used improperly, it can threaten the security of the user's property and privacy, causing great distress to personal life, such as online fraud, credit card theft, etc.
      </p></h4>
    </ol>
    
    <h2><p>Recommendations</p></h2>
    <h4><p>To optimise the precise placement of Internet advertising, it is necessary to improve the quality of content and customise differentiation strategies at the level of advertising content; at the level of advertising platform placement, it is necessary to segment user groups, precisely target audiences, optimise the frequency of advertising placement and improve the effectiveness of placement; the needs of advertising audiences also change rapidly, which brings a higher challenge to the accuracy of big data. In this context, there are still many challenges and risks to overcome if Internet advertising and marketing is to achieve a win-win situation in terms of advertising effectiveness, delivery platform and user experience.
