<h2>Ethical Issues and Reflections</h2>
<p><h3>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h3></p>
<p>The precise delivery of online advertisements based on big data technology is to push advertisements according to the description of users' characteristics. User feature data comes from records of their daily use of the network. The records include browser searches, text messages and phone calls. Big data is about collecting data and then analyzing customer needs. Through the analysis of big data, various platforms push to customers the items they are interested in within a limited time. Then, big data information data will involve personal privacy issues or user information leakage problems. The current Internet era is more likely to lead to personal information leakage. Big data can analyze your needs based on how you use the Web, and in the same way infer your location and sensitive information based on how you use the web. This would mean that the network is completely important. Simply put, big data analysis will push advertising, in other words, will involve personal information. I don't know if the information collected by big data is with the consent of users or without their knowledge. I think there is no problem with big data analysis, because it will make the data more accurate and valuable. However, big data acquisition information sources need to be constrained.
